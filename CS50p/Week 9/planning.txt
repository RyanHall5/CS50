Initial Project thoughts/notes:
based on Cross-Country running
make a Runner class that stores PR's, grade, gender #done
get runners stats from a csv file #done
rank runners by grade and PR's aswell as regardless of grade #done
make a function to sort athletes by PR grade and gender #didnt need a function
make a function that gets the average mile pace for a runner's PR #done (inside of the runner class)
make a function that lets you find a runner's rank
make a function that lets you find what runner is at a specific rank
make a function that displays the top n ranks names and times
make a function that formats times from seconds to minutes #decided not to store times in seconds because it would be more work
