1000000 simulations: 0m6.867s

Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I thought that the time would just 10x every time but it did not for the first few simulations although from 100k to 1m the time did 10x itself

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would call it good after the 100k simulations because the numbers were more accurate than the 10k simulation
but practically the exact same as the 1mil simulations. But the 1mil simulations took 6 seconds and the 100k only took about half a second so I'd say the 100k is the most worth it.
