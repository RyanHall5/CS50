If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
get the average value for each of the relevant values of the songs like tempo, danceability, energu, loudness, speechiness, and valence and determine what genre they ar emost like.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Getting the average might not represent what they actually listen do if they listen to multiple genres. Maybe instread use their most listened to songs and get the genre of their most listented to songs then determine their overall based off of those.
